# Haunting Hunters Map for Minecraft 1.15

The Grand Scheme of Things, "Haunting Hunters" was a group project to create a fun and unique take on the classic Hide & Seek formula. Hide inside or outside the great mansion or seek to find and kill the hiders. Use a range of powerups to your advantage, bought before the game, to help you score the victory for your team.
